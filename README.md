### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a passionate Data Scientist 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI to fight water pollution and floods in Northern America at [Infinitii AI](https://www.infinitii.ai/) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about our local chapter of [Women in Machine Learning & Data Science ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-machine-learning-data-science-poland/)
 (WiMLDS) which I co-founded.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm an active member and global ambassador of [WomenTech network](https://www.womentech.net/), member of [Women in AI](https://www.womeninai.co/) (WAI) and a member of [The International Society for Data Science and Analytics](https://isdsa.org/) (ISDSA)
